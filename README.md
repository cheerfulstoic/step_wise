# StepWise

`StepWise` is an Elixir library to wrap sequences of code which might fail.

 * It encourages standards by requiring the use of `{:ok, _}` and `{:error, _}` tuples (no `:ok`, or `{:error, _, _}`)
 * It rescues / catches anything which bubbles up so that you don't have to.  All exceptions/throws can be returned as `{:error, _}` tuples with` StepWise.resolve` or raised as an exception with `StepWise.resolve!`
 * It can perform operations on enumerables, requiring that each iteration succeeds (via `StepWise.map_step`)
 * It sends `telemetry` events which you can subscribe to do whatever you like across all processes using `StepWise` (i.e. logging, metrics, tracing, etc...)

# Code Sample



```elixir
defmodule MyApp.NotifyCommenters do
  def run(post) do
    post
    |> StepWise.step(&get_comments/1)
    |> StepWise.map_step(&get_commenter/1)
    |> StepWise.step(&notify_users/1)
    |> StepWise.resolve()
  end

  def get_comments(post) do
    # ...
  end

  def get_commenter(comment) do
    # ...
  end

  def notify_users(user) do
    # ...
  end
end
```




# TODO TODO TODO

 * Ability to pass in options to signify telemetry metadata


Explination TODOs:

 * The library is good for situations when you want to make sure that exceptions are turned into tuples and you donâ€™t want to have to catch things individually (web request?)
